## FAQ

#### What makes this different from Visual Studio Code and Vim

Unlike Visual Studio Code and Vim. OpenVironment, and other products by Viron are specifically made for the GNU/Linux operating system. Which means Viron products will get long-term support (LTS) for Linux machines.

#### Viron Pro isn't free, linux only uses freeware

Viron is not freeware as it falls under the GNU General Public License and Viron Pro is proprietary software, but anyone can still use it since it functions the same as Viron but requires users to buy a license to be able to use the complete bundle.
